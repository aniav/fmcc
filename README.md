# female¬ªmale color converter 

The project aims to help people understand color names. Simply no more than that.

It was created in 2008 as an aim to learn and understand jQuery. It used to have a backend in Django at that time but let's face the truth, Django is an overkill for such a simple tool. I have abandoned the project after changing hosting in 2012 but people kept asking about it long after. In 2015 I have moved it to github pages and it is now completely readonly with HTML, updated jQuery and CSS. The database is now a json file which is free to be used.

I don't intend to update the code more than it will be required to just work üçí
